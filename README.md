# PDF Generation Service
## Using Spring Boot & Flying Saucer

Simple service that takes a URL parameter, converts it into a PDF, and serves it to the user. Right now it's pretty picky about well-formed and valid HTML.

### Todo
- Sanitize URL inputs
- Better error handling
- Unit tests (I guess)
- Add toggle for downloading file vs browser view
